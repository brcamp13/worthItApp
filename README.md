### To-Do: 
- [x] Pass dropdown selection from first page to second page
- [ ] Make the site not crash if you refresh second page (have initialized state)
- [ ] Format the second page
- [ ] Test the entire app flow from beginning to end
- [ ] Better style the first page
- [ ] Transition effect when moving between pages
- [ ] Format for mobile and different-sized devices
- [ ] Research information for most majors (or the most popular)
- [ ] Derive an objective metric for determining the worth of a major
- [ ] Deploy
- [ ] Ads/Google analytics?

### Ideas: 
## Make the app entirely single-page (Which content is displayed depends on a "buttonWasPressed" conditional, or similar)
## Doing so would make a transition effect much easier, and would probably make the app not crash upon refreshing
## It would also make obtaining the dropdown selection and using it in the second content block much easier (no more React router trickery)
